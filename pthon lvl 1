## Why Learn Python?

Python is a powerful and easy-to-understand language.  
Whether you want to build websites, analyze data, make games, or learn artificial intelligence – Python is a great starting point.  
Python code looks almost like English!

---

## Getting Started With Python

To follow along:
- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Or try running code online using websites like [repl.it](https://replit.com/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Printing Your First Message

Let’s make Python say hello!  
We use the `print()` function to display text.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Try typing this in your Python editor and run it.  
What do you see?  
> **Output:**  
> Hello, world!

**Tip:**  
In Python, anything between quotes (`"..."` or `'...'`) is treated as text, also called a string.

---

## Understanding Variables

Variables are like boxes that store information for you.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 10
```

Now, `name` has the value `"Alice"`, and `age` has the number `10`.

You can print them too:

```python
print(name)
print(age)
```

> Output:  
> Alice  
> 10  

**Try This:**  
Change `name` and `age` to your own and print again!

---

## Working With Numbers

You can ask Python to do math for you!

```python
a = 7
b = 3
print("Sum:", a + b)
print("Product:", a * b)
print("Power:", a ** b)  # a raised to the power b
```

> Output:  
> Sum: 10  
> Product: 21  
> Power: 343  

---

## Taking Input From Users

What if you want to ask the user for their name?

```python
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Nice to meet you,", user_name)
```

When you run this, Python waits for you to type your answer.

---

## Making Decisions: If Statements

Let’s tell the computer to make decisions.

```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
else:
    print("You are a minor!")
```

Python checks the condition inside the `if`. If it's true, it runs the code under `if`. Otherwise, it runs the `else` part.

---

## Looping: While and For Loops

Sometimes you want to repeat actions.

**While Loop:**  
```python
count = 1
while count <= 3:
    print("Count is", count)
    count = count + 1
```

**For Loop:**  
```python
for i in range(1, 4):
    print("i is", i)
```

---

## Lists: Storing Many Values

A list lets you keep many items together.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])   # apple
print(fruits[1])   # banana

for fruit in fruits:
    print("I like", fruit)
```

You can add to a list:

```python
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)
```

---

## Functions: Reusing Code

If you want to do the same thing more than once, write a function!

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```

---

## Dictionaries and More

A dictionary is like a real dictionary: it has a word and a meaning.
In Python, it's a way to pair different bits of information.

```python
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 16}
print(person["name"])
print(person["age"])
```

---

## Going Further

This is just the beginning!

Try making your own calculator, a guessing game, or anything you can dream of.

Keep coding, keep learning, and most importantly, have fun!
