## 1. What Are Functions and Why Use Them? <a name="functions"></a>

In Python, a **function** is like a small machine: you give it some input, and (maybe) it gives you back an answer.
Functions help avoid repeating yourself and keep code tidy.

**Example:**

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
```

Try making your own function!  
**Tip:** Functions start with `def`, followed by a name, then parentheses and a colon.  
The code inside must be indented.

## 2. Getting More from Lists <a name="lists"></a>

In Level 1, you learned how to make lists. Now let’s do more with them.

**Loop over a list:**

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
for color in colors:
    print("I like", color)
```

**List methods:**  
- `append(item)` – adds to the end
- `remove(item)` – removes the first such item
- `len(list)` – gets length

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.append(4)
print(numbers)              # [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.remove(2)
print(numbers)              # [1, 3, 4]
print(len(numbers))         # 3
```

## 3. Dictionaries: Storing Pairs of Data <a name="dictionaries"></a>

A **dictionary** matches one thing to another (like a word and its meaning).

```python
student = {
    "name": "Jenny",
    "grade": 95
}
print(student["name"])    # Jenny
student["grade"] = 97
print(student)
```

**Loop through a dictionary:**

```python
for key in student:
    print(key, ":", student[key])
```

---

## 4. Working With Strings – Some Useful Tricks <a name="strings"></a>

Strings are more than just simple text!

**Lowercase, uppercase, and replace:**

```python
msg = "Hello, World!"
print(msg.lower())         # hello, world!
print(msg.upper())         # HELLO, WORLD!
print(msg.replace("Hello", "Hi"))  # Hi, World!
```

**Splitting and joining text:**

```python
sentence = "apple,banana,cherry"
fruits = sentence.split(",")
print(fruits)              # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

joined = " & ".join(fruits)
print(joined)              # apple & banana & cherry
```

## 5. Error Handling – Don’t Let Your Program Crash! <a name="errors"></a>

Sometimes your code might run into problems (like dividing by zero or a wrong input).
You can “catch” these errors with `try` and `except`:

```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print("10 divided by", num, "is", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You can't divide by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("That wasn’t a number!")
```

## 6. Reading and Writing Files <a name="files"></a>

Want to save data or read from a text file? It’s simple!

**Write to a file:**
```python
with open("mydata.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello file!")
```

**Read from a file:**
```python
with open("mydata.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

**Tip:**  
`with open(...) as file:` automatically closes the file when you’re done.

---

## 7. Importing Modules and Using More Python <a name="modules"></a>

Python comes with extra **modules** (collections of code) you can use.

```python
import random

x = random.randint(1, 100)
print("A random number:", x)
```

You can even write your own file (like `mytools.py`) with your own functions,
then import it in another file with `import mytools`.

## 8. What’s Next? <a name="whats-next"></a>

Great work!  
You’ve now learned ways to make your programs:
- Easier to manage
- Able to handle errors
- More powerful with lists, dictionaries, files, and modules

Try making a contact list, a small calculator, or a guessing game!

Ready for Level 3? That’s where you’ll learn about list comprehensions, lambdas, classes, and more.  
Keep going, and have fun with your code!
